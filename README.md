# Roulette Js

Roulette is a game of chance in which a small ball is dropped onto a wheel that is spinning and the players guess in which hole it will finally stop. Players can make bets on various elements such as single bets, column bets and even/odd bets. 

For this project, I created a mini roulette game using JavaScript with simple betting features.

# How to play?

The rules of the game are rather simple. The player first makes a choice on the type of bet they want. For this game, they have the option of placing bets on:

1. Single Bets: Choosing a single number from the roulette table
2. Even/Odd Bets: Placing a bet on whether the outcome will produce an even or odd number.
3. Red/Black: Placing a bet on whether the number is in a red or black box.
4. Column Bet: Placing a bet on which column the ball will end up in.

For convenience, I've included an image of a whole roulette set up below.

## Challenges

I had some trouble with making sure the conditionals ran smoothly. Additionally, the CSS proved to be a challenge. I tried to create an interactive roulette board for the single bet section and had trouble with the alignment.  

## Future Work/Steps

1. Having a fully interactive roulette board vis-a-vis just the single bet portion.
2. Having a betting system which fully reflect the odds you would get in a casino.
3. Having a ball spinning animation which would land on a random hole to determine the outcome.
