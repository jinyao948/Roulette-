# Roulette Js

Roulette is a game of chance in which a small ball is dropped onto a wheel that is spinning and the players guess in which hole it will finally stop. Players can make bets on various elements such as single bets, column bets and even/odd bets. 

For this project, I created a mini roulette game using JavaScript with simple betting features.

# How to play?

The rules of the game are rather simple. The player first makes a choice on the type of bet they want. For this game, they have the option of placing bets on:

1. Single Bets: Choosing a single number from the roulette table
2. Even/Odd Bets: Placing a bet on whether the outcome will produce an even or odd number.
3. Red/Black: Placing a bet on whether the number is in a red or black box.
4. Column Bet: Placing a bet on which column the ball will end up in.

For convenience, I've included an image of a whole roulette set up below (not the game interface :P)

Do note that I do not advocate excessive gambling :) 

## Challenges

I had some trouble with making sure the conditionals ran smoothly and hence, spent quite a bit of time trying to debug it. Through the process, I learnt alot about how to debug errors as well the importance of having the right catch all statement. 

Other lessons learnt include knowing when to move on to the next section. Often I would find myself spending excessive time on small issues.

Additionally, the CSS proved to be a challenge. I tried to create an interactive roulette board for the single bet section and had trouble with the alignment. The alignment is still a little off but I'll work on it in the future. CSS continues to be a challenge for me and I'll need to find a way to really brush up on those skills.   

## Future Work/Steps

1. Having a fully interactive roulette board vis-a-vis just the single bet portion.
2. Having a betting system which fully reflect the odds you would get in a casino.
3. Having a ball spinning animation which would land on a random hole to determine the outcome.
